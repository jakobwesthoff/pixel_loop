# üèñÔ∏è Pixel Sand üèúÔ∏è

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

## Overview
Pixel Sand is a simple simulator of falling sand using the Pixel Loop engine. It is currently in a very early stage of development and will be further developed over time.

## Features
- Simulates the movement of sand particles
- Utilizes the Pixel Loop engine for rendering

## Future Plans
- Enhance sand particle interactions
- Implement additional materials and behaviors
- Improve overall simulation performance

## Build Instructions
To build the Pixel Sand simulator along with the Pixel Loop engine, follow the build instructions provided in the main Pixel Loop repository.

## Usage
Once built, run the `pixel_sand` binary to start the simulation. Experiment with different settings and observe the behavior of the falling sand particles.

**Note:** This project is in its early stages, and significant changes and enhancements are planned for the future.

## Controls

Press the Mouse button within the canvas and hold to place sand particles.

Press the W key for "Waterfall" mode. (Press again to disable)
Press the F key for "Fountains" mode. (Press again to disable)
