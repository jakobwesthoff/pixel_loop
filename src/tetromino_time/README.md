# ðŸŽ® Tetromino Time ðŸ•™

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

## Overview
Tetromino Time is a timer based on [pixel_loop](http://github.com/jakobwesthoff/pixel_loop), utilizing Tetrominos to "build up the time to display".

## Acknowledgement

Kudos to Mike for his outstanding work and the inspiration provided!
